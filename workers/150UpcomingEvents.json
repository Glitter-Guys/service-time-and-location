But *writing* concurrent programs is complicated, intimidating to newcomers, and often challenging even for experts.</p> <p>Does it have to be? Python is famous for being simple and straightforward; can Python make concurrent programming simple and straightforward too? I think so. By carefully analyzing usability pitfalls in other libraries, and taking advantage of new Python 3 features, I've come up with a new set of primitives that make it dramatically easier to write correct concurrent programs, and implemented them in a new library called [Trio](<a href=\"https://trio.readthedocs.io\" class=\"linkified\">https://trio.readthedocs.io</a>). In this talk, I'll describe these primitives, and demonstrate how to use them to implement a basic algorithm for speeding up</p> <p>Bio: Nathaniel J. Smith is a cognitive scientist and open-source developer, currently at the UC Berkeley Institute for Data Science. He's a core developer on NumPy and CPython, brought the '@' operator to Python, co-designed matplotlib's \"viridis\" colormap, instigated the creation of \"manylinux\" wheels, and writes too many PEPs. He won't be talking about any of that.</p> <p>— Nim for Python programmers, by Abhishek Kapatkar</p> <p>Ever wondered if there existed a language as expressive as Python and as efficient as C/C++? Look no further then. Nim is a statically typed, compiled language with a focus on efficiency. It is versatile and borrows much of its constructs and standard library design from Python <a href=\"https://nim-lang.org\" class=\"linkified\">https://nim-lang.org</a></p> <p>Bio: Abhishek Kapatkar works at Netflix on Machine learning infrastructure team, whose mission is to make using data easy and efficient. He and his team are responsible for envisioning how the data platform allows data scientists to make Netflix's service even better. He enjoys product development, programming language design, and is passionate about the usage of technology for the social good and currently serves as a San Francisco chapter leader for Datakind.org.</p> <p><br/>AGENDA:</p> <p>6:00p - Check-in and mingle, with food provided by our generous sponsor Yelp!</p> <p>7:05p - Welcome</p> <p>7:10p - Announcements, lightning talks, and main talk</p> <p>7:30p - Doors Close</p> <p>8:20p - More mingling</p> <p>9:30p - Hard Stop</p> <p>**SF Python is run by volunteers aiming to foster the Python Community in the bay area.

This is the event for you!</p> <p><img src=\"http://photos2.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/4/4/e/600_457621102.jpeg\" /></p> <p>Join us for a day of fun with KEEN!</p> <p>Volunteers are paired up with a KEEN athlete to help get them past any sensitivity issues of getting in the water. We make sure that the swimmers keep their heads above water, connect with the coach (Coach Joey), stay safe, and most importantly, have fun. The pool is stocked with plenty of inflatable shimshams - balls, noodles, toys, etc to help athletes take part in different activities in the pool.</p> <p>The session starts with an orientation at 11:30, the kids arrive at 11:45 and it finishes at 12:45. The pool provides a locker room and lifeguard, all you need is a towel. Volunteers are also encouraged to do a few laps after the session is over.</p> <p>There's street parking in the area, but remember it's North Beach so parking can be difficult. Sundays are better and I've been able to find parking within a few blocks of the pool.</p> <p>So that everybody has a safe and fun time in the pool, we'd like to ask:</p> <p>• females wear a t-shirt over your swimsuit</p> <p>• always keep your athlete to the front of you</p> <p>• arrive early to park</p> <p>• bring your suit &amp; towel</p> <p>• &amp; have fun!!</p> <p>If you're interested, we can grab a bite to eat afterwards. Just bring a few bucks.</p> <p>KEEN (<a href=\"http://www.keensanfrancisco.org/\" class=\"linkified\">http://www.keensanfrancisco.org/</a>), Kids Enjoy Exercise Now, is a national, nonprofit volunteer-led organization that provides one-to-one recreational opportunities for children and young adults with developmental disabilities (<a href=\"http://www.keensanfrancisco.org/node/19\" class=\"linkified\">http://www.keensanfrancisco.org/node/19</a>) at no cost to their families and caregivers.

Besides being the answer to most interview questions, an algorithm is a way to solve a particular problem in programming.</p> <p>Google Maps uses an algorithm to calculate driving directions through 3 cities while avoiding highways. Amazon uses an algorithm to figure out exactly what product to recommend to you next so that you'll blindly one-click it.</p> <p>In this workshop, we will discuss what an algorithm is, introduce the idea of algorithmic complexity (big O notation), demonstrate sort and search algorithms (with a hands-on re-enactment), and finish with an overview of the many types of algorithms out there.</p> <p>This workshop focuses on design-thinking for algorithms, which is a pre-requisite to expressing these ideas in code. It will be taught by Christina Foran, Software Engineer at Slack, and Kristin Mayer, Software Engineer at CoderPad.</p> <p>Topics covered:<br/>• Defining an algorithm<br/>• Data structures<br/>• Time/space complexity<br/>• Several sorting algorithms<br/>• Binary search<br/>• Algorithms in real life</p> <p>Slides: <a href=\"http://www.teaching-materials.org/algorithms/\" class=\"linkified\">http://www.teaching-materials.org/algorithms/</a></p> <p>Prerequisites: Attendees would benefit from a basic understanding of a programming language, like from JS 101, but that is not required.</p> <p>Tech requirements:<br/>• Your laptop with a charger<br/>• A modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari)</p> <p>If you do not have a laptop, please contact the instructor.

Headlamps or flashlights recommended for short sections of the trail but the objective is to enjoy hiking in the moonlight with no or very limited artificial illumination. Level: Moderate ++ (2C) Not a beginner’s hike as this hike will be difficult for new hikers, hikers out of shape or those with phobias about hiking at night. We will stop on a regular basis but must complete the hike by 10pm when the park closes. This means we have 3.5 hours to complete a 7 mile hike with significant elevation gain. If you are unsure about your physical condition, please hike another day where the time required to complete the hike is not an issue. Exiting the park after 10pm can lead to a misdemeanor charge of trespassing by EBRPD.</p> <p>Estimated Distance of Hike: Seven + miles</p> <p>Gross Elevation Gain: 2100 ft.</p> <p>Parking Cost: $ 4.00 parking fee if you park in the Ohlone College multi story garage. Free if you park on Mission Blvd. and walk onto campus. If you park off campus, walk up Pine Street until you see the multi-story garage on your left. It is the building that has multi-floors and looks like a parking garage. We will meet across the street at the trail head.</p> <p>Bring: Two liters of water, lamp, snack, layered clothing, and enthusiasm. Recommend well-fitting boots for traction and ankle support. Hiking poles may be helpful.</p> <p>Cancellation: Activity is held rain or cloudy weather, but may be altered due to snow or hail.</p> <p>Carpool: We recommend you arrange your own carpools where it is most convenient for you. The nearest BART station is the Fremont Warm Springs BART Station. Meet: Entrance to the park - above the tennis courts at the Ohlone College trailhead to the Peak Trail. Park entrance is across the street from the parking structure located at the end of Pine Street.</p> <p>Directions: Ohlone College is located in the City of Fremont on Mission Blvd.</p> <p>Trail Map <a href=\"http://www.ohlone.edu/core/mapsdirs/directions/tofremont.html\" class=\"linkified\">http://www.ohlone.edu/core/mapsdirs/directions/tofremont.html</a></p> <p>Ohlone Parking Structure: <a href=\"http://www.ohlone.edu/core/mapsdirs/parking/parkingstructure.html\" class=\"linkified\">http://www.ohlone.edu/core/mapsdirs/parking/parkingstructure.html</a></p> ",

In nonchronological fashion, the novel covers more than 30 years in the lives of a group of upper-middle-class English friends, especially Anthony Beavis and his longtime married lover, Helen. His intense prep-school friendships continue at Oxford; most important are his relationships with Brian Foxe, who later commits suicide; with Hugh Ledwidge, who marries Helen; and with Mark Staithes, who becomes a Marxist and with whom Beavis goes to Mexico to fight in a revolution. While in Mexico, Beavis adopts a Buddhist-centered philosophy, practices meditation, and becomes a pacifist. Written at the height of his powers immediately after Brave New World, Aldous Huxley's highly acclaimed Eyeless in Gaza is his most personal novel.<br/>Suggested by: Charlie</p> <p>MEETING FORMAT</p> <p>Book discussion meetings combine free-flowing conversation about the book, led by one volunteer, and information of interest about the book delivered via an informal presentation, led by another volunteer. The following is the East Bay Book Club's meeting format:</p> <p>1. Introduction of all attendees<br/>2. Biographical information about the author (no more than 10 minutes) and facts of interest about the book (no more than 10 minutes), all presented by the first volunteer<br/>3. Comments and thoughts on the book (approximately one hour), shared spontaneously or in response to discussion questions that the second volunteer writes or compiles<br/>4. Final thoughts on the book from all attendees (no more than one minute per attendee)</p> <p>If you would like to volunteer for either the author/book presentation or the discussion questions, please leave a comment below stating which role you would like to volunteer for. The Organizer and Co-Organizers will, if possible, make efforts to email everyone to ask for volunteers if needed. It is strongly encouraged that people who plan to attend the meeting consider volunteering to ensure the best possible book discussion experience.</p> <p>REMINDER ABOUT MEMBERSHIP FEE</p> <p>The East Bay Book Club charges a $5 membership fee that is good for one year. The fee, which is paid by cash or check, is due any time before the second meeting you attend after joining the club or after your previous membership expired. As the Organizer or Co-Organizer does roll call, he/she will check your membership status and let you know if and when a fee is due.</p> ",

            "description": "<p>This month, we will talk about Cultural Intelligence (CQ). If you’re a human being, there are multiple cultures you both represent and that you interact with on a daily basis. Cultural intelligence (CQ) is the capability to function effectively across national, ethnic, and organizational cultures. It's applications are many - if you’ve re-located to or are native to the San Francisco Bay Area, if you're a world traveler, assessing world news or even just riding BART ... Our CQ can always be improved.</p> <p>Behavioral Enthusiasts:<br/>Building community and creating engaged open, respectful, discussion is the intention for this event. If you’re interested in the topic, and meeting others, please come, even if you haven’t read the material. Every Behavioral Enthusiast has their own personal expertise in this subject.</p> <p>Discussion Catalysts*:<br/>o What is Cultural Intelligence?<br/>o The Four Factors of Cultural Intelligence<br/>o The 10 cultural value dimensions<br/>o Applying &amp; Improving CQ - in ourselves, others and society<br/>*Handouts will be available for all topics.</p> <p>“Everybody assumes that Cultural Intelligence comes from understanding other people’s cultures and the further I went the more I began to realize there was the one most difficult culture of them all to crunch which is your own. That’s the culture you really have to understand. Understand when it helps you and understand when it hinders you. Understand when it opens things up for you, when it closes things down; when it causes other people problems; when it gives you knots and when it misses you opportunities.” -Julia Middleton, TedTalk</p> <p>Book: Leading with Cultural Intelligence Master the One Skill You Can’t Do Without in Today’s Global Economy by David Livermore</p> <p>• What to bring<br/>Your openness and curiosity:-)</p> ",

She'll also share practical examples of actionable insights that can come from these types of studies.</p> <p>About Frances James:<br/>Frances has 10+ years of career experience in UX Research at various agencies and companies. Most recently she led mobile UX research at Netflix.

            "description": "<p>SAN FRANCISCO PREMIERE OF \"THE END OF MEAT,\" WED. MARCH 21 AT 6 PM, PLUS VEGAN DINNER</p> <p>Enjoy the San Francisco premiere of the ground-breaking German documentary, \"The End of Meat.\" This exciting movie reveals the hidden impact of meat consumption; explores the opportunities and benefits of a shift to a more compassionate diet; and raises critical questions about the future role of animals in our society.</p> <p>In Germany, home of bratwurst and schnitzel, meat is an integral part of the diet. That is, until a few years ago, when perceptions somewhat evolved. Health concerns and meat scandals led to a public debate about the ethical implications of meat consumption and the rise of plant-based diets. Meat producers launched their own vegan products; 100% vegan supermarkets opened; and almost every food manufacturer was adding and labeling vegan options. Is this the beginning of the end of meat? Are we approaching a turning point in the human-animal relationship?</p> <p>In The End of Meat, filmmaker Marc Pierschel embarks on a journey to discover what effect a post-meat world would have on the environment, the animals and ourselves. He meets Esther the Wonder Pig, who became an internet phenomenon; talks to pioneers leading the vegan movement in Germany; visits the first fully vegetarian city in India; witnesses rescued farm animals enjoying their newly found freedom; observes the future food innovators making meat and dairy without the animals, even harvesting “bacon” from the ocean and much more.</p> <p>Along with the movie, enjoy a FABULOUS, full-course vegan dinner planned and presented by an acclaimed Bay Area food professional, Patricia Allen Koot, NE, NC. All vegan, all health-supporting, cooked without oils or added sugars, and all you care to eat! Dinner includes beverages and dessert.<br/>Bring a container and take some home with you. And, enjoy healthy but yummy table snacks during the movie.</p> <p>Location is a great venue in the heart of San Francisco, the Opera Plaza Community Room, 601 Van Ness, San Francisco. Take the elevator to the mezzanine, then follow the sign down the hall to the right. A giant screen, and sound by Bose, add to the ambiance to make it a truly enjoyable experience.</p> <p>You get the premiere, and a full-course dinner, for the price of a movie ticket. Fifteen bucks, requested donation. Why? Because we are a nonprofit here to serve the community. The Nutritionist donates her time. Funds go toward facility rental, food, transport and other costs.</p> <p>RSVP to reserve your place! We expect a full house, so act now. Do so here, or email to: [masked] OR call (888)[masked]</p> <p>See you there!</p> ",

We all decide on the story topics that night, so it's SPONTANEOUS! And, if you get up to tell a spontaneous story, you win a free drink ticket! Entry is FREE!</p> <p>How it works: When you enter into the bar, get an icebreaker Game Card and grab a pen. The object of the game is to talk to as many people as possible, note down their answer, and then turn it in. You'll automatically start thinking of stories as you go.</p> <p>After the icebreaker game it's time for open-mic true, personal stories on whatever themes we come up with. You're all primed to tell or just listen to others.

Websites for the various organizations are below.</p> <p>Once the event starts, I'll post a comment to this meetup that will include a link to a Glympse map. You'll be able to use that link to find me and the group via my GPS location.  All you need is a smartphone to use that link, no need to have Glympse installed.</p> <p>Here's the route we'll take, which is another way to find us, if you can recognize me or someone else in the group. We'll hit every gallery on the south side of 25th street, headed from Telegraph to Broadway, then we'll head to 26th street and head from Broadway to Telegraph, hitting every gallery on both sides of the street.</p> <p>Please note: once we leave FM Art Gallery at 7:15pm I won't be checking for comments on the meetup page, so I can focus on the group.

We'll pass the upside-down rectangular-pyramid that pays homage to one of the oldest race (group of people) in history.  We'll pause at the 164 year old church (and still standing), and travel underneath a water fall. Then we'll take a break to make some oragami boats, (put your wish in them) and send them down the stream. </p> <p>Next, we'll go visit a Grand Garden Court fit for a king or queen (bring your cameras). We'll hike a bit more to discover a few more beautiful water fountains and gardens, hidden inside the city. Have you ever seen it rain indoors? We're going to see that too. Lastly, we'll end our journey on one of the pier to watch the sunset, moon rise and the lights on the Bay Bridge.  Afterwards, we can grab drinks and/or food at Palomio to end our glorious day in San Francisco. (NOTE: last time a demonstration interfered with our schedule so if that happens again we'll play it by ear and adjust our path as needed.) </p> <p><br/>***** Approximate Schedule:  *****</p> <p><br/>3:00 - Roof Garden above Crocker Galleria, next to the giant compass. Check-in from 3:00-3:15pm. We leave at 3:20pm. </p> <p>3:45 - Yerba Buena gardens (Mission St between 3rd &amp; 4th) </p> <p>4:45 - Market Street Plaza (Market &amp; 1st) or 560 Mission Street Plaza</p> <p>5:15 - Rincon Center, 121 Spear St (inside)(note: it closes at 5:30pm)</p> <p>5:45 - Pier 14 (off The Embarcadero x Mission St) </p> <p>6:15  - Palomino is at 345 Spear Street, San Francisco, CA 94105 </p> <p>NO EVENT CELL PHONE. If you miss the meet up time, try to find us at one of the stops above and then check-in with me.</p> <p>Directions to the Roof Garden above Crocker Galleria: when you get to the Galleria, take the escalators to the top floor. When you get off the top escalator, look to your left, in that walk way there are stairs leading up to the roof top. There is a sign that says Roof Garden but it's hard to see. Meet us at the compass structure (see photo). </p> <p>Dao</p> <p>You're invited to Friend me on Facebook, <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/dao.nguyen.2188003\"><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/dao.nguyen.2188003\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.facebook.com/dao.nguyen.2188003</a></a></p> <p>\n\n\n<img src=\"http://photos3.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/4/e/f/e/600_287060222.jpeg\" /></p> <p>\n\n\n<img src=\"https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/3/7/b/6/highres_436034262.jpeg\" /></p> <p>\n\n\n<img src=\"https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/3/7/b/4/highres_436034260.jpeg\" /></p> <p>\n\n\n<img src=\"https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/3/7/b/d/highres_436034269.jpeg\" /></p> <p>\n\n\n<img src=\"https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/3/7/c/6/highres_436034278.jpeg\" /></p> <p>\n\n\n<img src=\"https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/3/7/c/b/highres_436034283.jpeg\" /></p> ",

I discovered this place as I was on my way home heading towards 24th Street BART Station one day by simply following the chamber music playing that led me right to this fave hangout spot of mine in the heart of the Mission District.</p> <p>They have happy hour besides sandwiches and other snacks there too!

YO MOMMA! - 2016 - It's about to get incandescent! With DJ Donovan Gordo Cabeza &amp; Timbeauxtronic One at The Madrones on Divis</p> <p>If You &lt;3 Motown...</p> <p><br/>Last night was the biggest <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/momoaktown/\">MOM Oakland</a> party to date, as we celebrated this chapter's 3yr Anniversary. We literally took all the furniture out of the two levels of <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/LegionnaireSaloon/\">The Legionnaire Saloon</a> to make the most space possible and managed to pack them both with beautiful dancing souls on a Monday night. People came from far and wide, and there were many legends amongst us. Meanwhile just 20 mins away at MOM SF they apparently hit capacity around 9:00. We are so thankful to all of you who support and take part in these incredible gatherings.</p> <p><br/>Dance when you want, don't have to wait for normal club hours. DJ Phleck &amp; Gordo will be at @harlotsf from 5-9pm today if the feeling strikes.</p> <p><br/><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10157394355540360&amp;set=a.10152725546480360.1073741827.545360359&amp;type=3\">&lt;/a&gt;</p> <p><br/>&lt;a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10157449241475360&amp;set=a.10150533271295360.638509.545360359&amp;type=3\"&gt;</a></p> ",

People that come include our regular members (not shown on MeetUp), people who work/live in the area that just show up (not shown on MeetUp), and people that hear about it through other channels, such as MeetUp (yourself).</p> <p>How It Works: Come alone or come with your own 4v4 team (we recommend a sub or two since it is a fast game). We organize into our teams, helping the free agents join a team or form their own team, then play in an organized tournament where each team is guaranteed 3 games. The best 2 teams from the tournament then compete in the championship game for the Drop-In Mini-Tournament Trophy! Field is turf. Bring your shorts and soccer shoes. We will provide bibs. Games are always on, rain or shine.</p> <p>About the Facility: The Street Soccer USA Park is a top of the line, small-sided outdoor soccer facility located at 200 Terry A Francois Blvd (in Lot A of the Giants Ballpark). It has two german-engineered 4v4 fields with high quality turf and non-toxic infill, electronically connected scoreboards, and an outdoor speaker system for music. Besides drop-in games, the Street Soccer USA Park offers 4v4 leagues, and youth programming.</p> <p>Price: $15 per player (inquire about our memberships for a lower rate).

Criticized for being too slow, clunky, or awkward, most folks are moving away from Graphite to other tools promising horizontal scaling, SQL-ish syntax, and fancy, shiny moving parts. We'll discuss why Graphite's simple Whisper file backend might be all you need. We'll try squeezing all the performance we can from the official Graphite applications. The talk will cover some features in the new 1.1.x branch and how you can use Graphite to be more successful.</p> <p>---</p> <p>Doors open at 6:30pm.

See below for parking information.</p> <p>This meetup will be a self-directed programming session without a fixed plan or leader. Just bring whatever tutorials, books, courses, or projects that you're working on. You can meet people, find a partner for pair programming, talk about technology, find/create a study group, work on a personal or group project, or just study a book or tutorial.</p> <p>Sometimes there are (optional) programming puzzles and algorithms to work on with other attendees. See the schedule on the website (<a href=\"https://codeselfstudy.com/featured\" class=\"linkified\">https://codeselfstudy.com/featured</a>).</p> <p>Tip: we meet twice per week in Berkeley. Check out the main calendar for a list of events, and learn more about the group at <a href=\"https://codeselfstudy.com/\" class=\"linkified\">https://codeselfstudy.com/</a></p> <p>Parking Information: parking in Downtown Berkeley can sometimes be difficult, because of the construction. It's often easier to park at a nearby BART station and then take a train one stop to Downtown Berkeley. North Berkeley BART Station and Ashby BART Station are good options on Saturdays. The parking there is free on weekends, so you get all-day parking for the price of a round-trip BART ticket (less than $4).</p> ",

They held a lovely event. The group energy was high, lots of love and acceptance.<br/>Juan Acosta Urquidi</p> <p>What a beautiful afternoon! I'm still luxuriating in the sweet medicine of unconditional love and respect which flowed through our Puja. Katherine L Potter and Zagreus Wolf , everyone ,thank you for doing this healing work. &amp;lt;3<br/>Rachel Cohen-Cepeda</p> <p>By popular request, we will be reprising our most popular format... a somewhat shorter puja with extra time devoted to cuddling at the end. Katherine will be hosting this month and will be bringing her special magic to entice and delight your senses. Come join us for a delicious afternoon of connection, exploration and lots of really yummy cuddles in a nourishing and safe space. I love you all and look forward to serving you again soon!</p> ",
